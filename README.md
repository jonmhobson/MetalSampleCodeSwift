# MetalSampleCodeSwift
Swift ports of Apple's Objective-C / C++ sample code

Metal is a great API, but it can feel inaccessible for Swift developers due to all the samples being written in C++ or Objective-C. 

Swift's more concise syntax and reduced boilerplate can also make the code a lot more readable.

Most game developers are coming from C++ so I understand why the samples are in C++ / Objective-C, but the goal of this project is to port all of the Metal samples so that App developers can also learn metal without such a large barrier to entry.

In the first pass only the macOS targets will be ported as the other targets add a lot of clutter, and the code is being tested on Apple Silicon and may not work on Intel.
